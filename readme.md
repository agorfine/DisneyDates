## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

Four my fourth project, I have decided to create Disney Dates- a dating app for people with a mutual love of all things Disney. The app will be created with React Native, and supported by an external Express database. Users will create an account or sign in through Facebook. Once the user is logged in, they can edit their profile settings including the gender of their love interest, the location range, and the age range. The user will also have to edit their profile to include photos, and answer questions regarding their favorite Disney things. After this is determined, the user can swipe through profiles of potential matches. If the user swipes right, and the other user reciprocates, they will match! Once a user has matches they are able to message eachother through chat in hopes of finding their one true love!

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.  

[Priority Matrix](https://res.cloudinary.com/drsaojfyp/image/upload/v1542744440/Disney_Dates-_Priority_Matrix.pdf)


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Load page
- Login with FacebookSDK
- Create user account with email address
- Edit user account to include photos and answer questions/bio
- Edit user settings to include choosing own identity/interested identity
- Log out of user account
- Swipe page/swipe function of liked/not liked
- Making two accounts match if both swipe right 
- Display matches on mouseages page
- Create display for all components (clicking buttons to navigate to each page)



#### PostMVP 

- Create chat between matches
- Edit the range of distance of people to swipe 
- Edit the range of age of people to swipe 
- Connect Instagram account to profile 


## Architectural Design

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

##Time Frames

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| App | H | 3hrs | 2hrs | 2hrs |
